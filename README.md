# GeoQuiz

GeoQuiz app from the Big Nerd Ranch "Android Programming" Book

This is the first app in the book. It covers initial basic concepts of Android programming.

The app has a small database of True/False geography questions. Users can loop through questions and get feedback if they answered correctly or not. Users also have the option to cheat to find the answer. However, their cheating history is maintained, and they are judged for it!
